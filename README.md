# Big O notation
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- O(1): describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(N): describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- O(N**2): represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2**N): denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.
- O(log N): The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
